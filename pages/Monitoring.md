- Monitoring is likely to be software-only, so possible to retrofit at any time, given enough hands
- The monitoring system, and in particular monitored metrics, will need to evolve with the needs of the project; this means it's potentially more important that there exists / there can be built competence with it in the core Ribbit team, than that it's a technologically / theoretically perfect fit.
- Dashboards should change frequently to represent the evolving understanding of what's actually important for understanding the behavior of individual devices, the fleet in aggregate, or central infrastructure components.
- Interesting observation: metric storage for some monitoring systems have overlap with technologies for [[Data Storage]]
