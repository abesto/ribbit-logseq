- It's very likely that there'll be multiple generations of Ribbit hardware.
- Software will accumulate complexity, and become exponentially harder to test, as hardware changes.
	- Ideally it'd be possible to retrofit previous generations, but we can't assume all owners will take the time and effort to do so.

- All this means that hardware is likely one of the areas where it's worth investing more effort to get it (mostly) right the first time around, or else to invest effort to make it *VERY* easy to change stuff later.
