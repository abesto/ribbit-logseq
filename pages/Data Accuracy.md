- For good actors looking for data supporting decisions, the burden of proof scales with the cost (monetary or otherwise) of actions.
- ((62dd6cdb-35f2-44d3-bf44-db49774978dd)) are likely to 1. try to increase the requested burden of proof 2. actively discredit proposed proofs of accuracy.
- So first off, the data collected needs to be accurate enough for Ribbit Network itself to believe the data provided is valuable.
- Second, as adoption increases, we need to be ahead of the curve on being able to provide proof that the data is accurate enough to take decisions of the size the adoption would otherwise support.
- Not my area, but it seems that [[Hardware Changes]] are likely to be needed if we find accuracy is not where it needs to be.
- Accuracy is not just a factor of "we have a good measurement here now": we need to prove that Ribbit sensors remain accurate under all the conditions where they may be deployed (rain, snow,  draughts, hot and cold air), over long periods of time (whatever the planned lifetime of a sensor is)
